## 📊 Data Structure

### Assets
```javascript
{
  id: string,           // Auto-generated (AST001, AST002, etc.)
  name: string,         // Asset name
  category: string,     // IT Equipment, Vehicles, etc.
  status: 'Active' | 'Inactive' | 'Maintenance' | 'Retired',
  assignedTo: string,   // Employee name
  purchaseDate: string, // ISO date string
  value: number,        // Asset value
  description: string   // Optional description
}
```

### Employees
```javascript
{
  id: string,           // Auto-generated (EMP001, EMP002, etc.)
  name: string,         // Employee name
  email: string,        // Email address
  department: string,   // Department name
  position: string,     // Job position
  hireDate: string,     // ISO date string
  assets: string[]      // Array of assigned asset IDs
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Tailwind CSS
The project uses Tailwind CSS with custom configuration:
- Custom color palette
- Extended spacing and sizing
- Custom animations and keyframes
- Component-based utility classes

### LocalStorage Keys
- `assets`: Asset data
- `employees`: Employee data
- `sidebarCollapsed`: Sidebar state
- `currentPage`: Current navigation page

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for environment-specific configuration:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=your-api-url
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Input validation on all forms
- XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping
- Secure localStorage usage for client-side data
- No sensitive data stored in client-side storage

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## 📈 Performance

- Lazy loading for route components
- Optimized bundle size with Tailwind CSS purging
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Minimal re-renders through proper component structure
- Optimized images and assets
